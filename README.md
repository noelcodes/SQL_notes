# SQL_notes
My own SQL and Tableau notes. Last min decided to brush up my SQL skill and next learn new skill called Tableau from Udemy. Don't run it, these are only my notes and sample codes for future reference. Codes below can be found here: https://github.com/noelcodes/mySQL_and-Tableau-notes/blob/master/noel_sql_notes.sql . But the screenshot (same code) looked better.
